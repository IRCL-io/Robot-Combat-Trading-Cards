## Entries
- Step: 1
- Role: Bootstrap
- Summary: Interpreted the cycle-01 prompt, defined objectives and risks, proposed team composition, and recommended plan adjustments.
- Decisions: Include SVG engineer and pipeline validation as part of cycle-01; emphasize TTDB RFC alignment.
- Open questions: What is the authoritative source for Bot Oblivion 2025 card data in this repo?
- Next step: Storyteller
- Step: 2
- Role: Storyteller
- Summary: Defined the narrative focus, themes, tone, and visual storytelling guidance for the Bot Oblivion 2025 card deck.
- Decisions: Prioritized documentary clarity and event identity markers across cards.
- Open questions: Confirm whether a dedicated event badge exists in current assets.
- Next step: SVG engineer
- Step: 3
- Role: SVG engineer
- Summary: Documented SVG layout constraints, rendering considerations, and guidance for consistent card output.
- Decisions: Preserve the 3x3 letter layout and Roboto font usage; prioritize deterministic SVG templates.
- Open questions: Whether to bundle fonts and event badge assets locally for offline rendering.
- Next step: Orchestrator
- Step: 4
- Role: Orchestrator
- Summary: Expanded cycle inputs and refined the critical path to emphasize TTDB compliance, card pipeline, and PDF validation.
- Decisions: Added RFCs and TTAI specs as required inputs; clarified core worker deliverables and review scope.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Core worker
- Step: 5
- Role: Core worker
- Summary: Created the Bot Oblivion 2025 TTDB dataset, promoted it to library, and refactored the card/PDF generator into a reusable CLI with organized output folders.
- Decisions: Default generator outputs to `cards/<event>` and `output/<event>`; retained SVG-based rendering with Inkscape.
- Open questions: Whether to bundle local font assets for offline rendering and to include an event-specific badge.
- Next step: Reviewer
- Step: 6
- Role: Reviewer
- Summary: Reviewed TTDB file structure, typed-edge compliance, and generator reuse; documented validation gaps.
- Decisions: Marked PDF resemblance as unverified pending a render run.
- Open questions: Run the generator to visually confirm PDF parity with the reference deck.
- Next step: Delivery packager
- Step: 7
- Role: Delivery packager
- Summary: Assembled delivery notes, documented dependencies and output paths, and updated release tracking.
- Decisions: Marked cycle status as in progress due to missing PDF render validation.
- Open questions: Run PDF generation once Inkscape is available to close the delivery gate.
- Next step: Retrospective
- Step: 8
- Role: Retrospective
- Summary: Added recommended plan adjustments and new next-cycle prompts to the bootstrap document.
- Decisions: Emphasized dependency checks, asset pinning, and PDF metadata validation for future cycles.
- Open questions: Which next-cycle prompt should be selected to proceed?
- Next step: Human selection for next cycle
- Step: 8a
- Role: Orchestrator
- Summary: Added explicit deliverable paths to PLAN entries to align with TTE-RFC-0002.
- Decisions: None.
- Open questions: None.
- Next step: Human selection for next cycle
