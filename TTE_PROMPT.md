# Toot-Toot Engineering Prompt

This repo currently contains the methods and artifacts involved in building the 2025 Bot Oblivion event.
We want a new IRCL TTE factory for building and maintaining a complete TTDB of IRCL events and the ability to produce from the TTDB, a print ready pdf of all the cards for an event.
Review the entire repo to fully understand, then continue to the end of cycle 1.

## deliverables
- a new IRCL TTDB containing the card and event data for Bot Oblivion 2025
- a "cards" folder populated with card images or the python to generate the images
- reusable python tool for producing a pdf of an event. That pdf should resemble Bot Oblivion 2025_deck.pdf.
