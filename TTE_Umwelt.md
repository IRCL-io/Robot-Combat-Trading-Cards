# Toot-Toot Engineering (TTE) Umwelt

## What This Document Is
This file describes the **umwelt** of Toot-Toot Engineering:  
the world as perceived, sensed, and acted upon by a TTE system.

An umwelt is not objective reality.  
It is the slice of reality that *matters* to a system.

TTE is designed around **maker-scale intelligence**, so its umwelt is practical, narrative, physical, and semantic rather than abstract or purely theoretical.

---

## Core Umwelt Principle
> **If it cannot be sensed, stored, related, or acted upon, it does not exist inside the TTE umwelt.**

TTE does not attempt to model the whole world.  
It models *what is useful for building, learning, sharing, and repairing*.

---

## Perceptual Domains

### 1. Physical World
TTE perceives the physical world through:
- Hardware components (microcontrollers, sensors, motors, LEDs)
- Tools (soldering irons, printers, cutters, oscilloscopes)
- Materials (plastic, metal, wood, wire)
- Space (benches, tables, floors, walls, enclosures)

Physical state is often **partial, approximate, and embodied**.

Examples:
- A robot is “working” or “not working,” not a full physics simulation.
- Voltage is “safe,” “borderline,” or “magic smoke imminent.”

---

### 2. Digital Artifacts
TTE’s digital umwelt includes:
- Markdown files
- Schematics and diagrams
- Source code
- STL / SVG / CAD files
- Logs, notes, prompts, and records

Digital artifacts are treated as **living objects**, not final products.

Edits, forks, comments, and annotations are first-class events.

---

### 3. Semantic Structures
Meaning is stored explicitly.

TTE perceives:
- Nodes (ideas, projects, devices, people, places)
- Typed edges (builds, references, inspired-by, located-at)
- IDs that remain stable even as content evolves

This semantic layer allows memory, narrative, and traversal.

Nothing is “just a file.”  
Everything can become a **place in the mental workshop**.

---

### 4. Social & Narrative Signals
TTE includes people in its umwelt, but not as abstract users.

Instead, it perceives:
- Builders
- Mentors
- Opponents
- Collaborators
- Future readers

Stories, explanations, and provenance matter as much as outcomes.

A build without a story is considered incomplete.

---

## Action Capabilities

Within its umwelt, TTE can:
- Create, modify, and connect artifacts
- Package knowledge into teachable forms
- Unpack workflows into runnable workshops
- Translate between human intuition and machine structure
- Support AI agents without surrendering human agency

TTE favors **reversible actions** and **inspectable state**.

---

## Blind Spots (By Design)
TTE intentionally does *not* attempt to:
- Optimize for scale beyond human comprehension
- Replace human judgment
- Enforce correctness over learnability
- Hide uncertainty or ambiguity

Unknowns are allowed.  
Rough edges are acceptable.  
Curiosity outranks polish.

---

## Relationship to AI
AI agents operating in TTE inherit this umwelt.

They:
- See what the files show
- Know what the semantic graph encodes
- Act only within permitted tools and representations

An AI in TTE is a **shop assistant**, not an oracle.

---

## Summary
The TTE umwelt is:
- 🛠️ **Maker-centered**
- 🧠 **Narrative-aware**
- 🧩 **Semantically explicit**
- 📦 **Packable and unpackable**
- 🔍 **Inspectable at every layer**

It is a world designed not to impress machines,  
but to help humans build things that work,  
and understand *why* they work.
