# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Narrative focus
Bot Oblivion 2025 is the proving ground. Each card should feel like a field report: a compact story of machine identity, arena lineage, and the builder's intent. The deck should read as a roster of contenders, not just a catalog.

## Core themes
- **Arena-as-archive:** every card is a snapshot of a combat history.
- **Builder voice:** the robot name, class, and signature traits signal personality.
- **Precision over spectacle:** clean technical clarity with a subtle sense of stakes.

## Visual storytelling guidance
- Emphasize readable hierarchy: robot name, weight class, builder, and event name.
- Keep action imagery consistent; treat it like evidence, not poster art.
- Maintain a consistent cadence across cards so the deck reads as one event story.

## Tone notes
- Terse, confident, and documentary.
- Avoid hype language; let data and image carry the drama.

## Practical cues for production
- Use repeatable layout blocks that can scale across events.
- Ensure the event badge or mark is visible on every card to reinforce the event identity.
